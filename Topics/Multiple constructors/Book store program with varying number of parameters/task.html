<h2>Book store program with varying number of parameters</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Consider a book store. Each book has three properties: 'title', 'author', and 'price'. Create a class named 'Book' with multiple constructors where 'title' and 'author' are mandatory, but 'price' is optional. Your constructor with 2 parameters (title, author) should set the price to 0. Your constructor with 3 parameters (title, author, price) should set the properties as given. You should also include an instance method 'getDetails' to return the details of the book in the format: title - author - price. Now, write a Java program that receives a line containing the title, author, and price of a book (separated by comma). If the price is missing, it should be considered as 0. The program should generate a new instance of 'Book' accordingly and print the details of the book using the 'getDetails' method.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Moby Dick,Herman Melville,10<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Moby Dick - Herman Melville - 10.0<br></code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee - 0.0<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
